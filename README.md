[*Pinster*](http://pinster.herokuapp.com/) - A rendition of Pinterest
=========
Built using Ruby on Rails. This is my first rails project! The gems I used are - 
- Bootstrap (as a front end Framework)
- Paperclip (for uploading images in png, jpg, jpeg and gif formats)
- will_paginate (for Paginating the pins)
- Jquery Masonry (A Jquery grid layout library for fitting pins in the available space like a mason fitting stones in a wall.) (My favorite gem in the project!)
- AWS (for storing my images on Heroku)
